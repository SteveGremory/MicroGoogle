# MicroGoogle
A google scraping RESTful API.

# Endpoints & Usage

To search google, construct a JSON Query with a structure similar to:
```
{
    "pages": "1",
    "query": "minecraft"
}
```
and POST it to `/search/google`. If nothing goes wrong, you should get a response that resembles:

```
{
    "response": [
        {
            "breadcrumb": "https://www.minecraft.net",
            "description": "Explore new gaming adventures, accessories, & merchandise on the Minecraft Official Site. Buy & download the game here, or check the site for the latestÂ ...",
            "link": "https://www.minecraft.net/",
            "title": "Welcome to the Minecraft Official Site | Minecraft"
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```
